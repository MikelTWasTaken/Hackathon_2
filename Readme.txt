# Hackathon Project: Exploring Employee Attrition and Performance

## Project Overview
This project will explore the factors contributing to employee attrition and environment satisfaction within a corporate environment, using the "IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance" dataset. The analysis aims to identify patterns and correlations that impact employee turnover, with the goal of developing strategies to improve retention, satisfaction, and performance.

**Dataset:** IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance

## Objectives
- **Identify causes of employee attrition**
- **Analyze relationships between employee satisfaction, job roles, and performance**
- **Develop strategies to reduce turnover and improve overall performance**

## Approach

### Part 1: Data Analysis

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Investigate the distribution of key variables like age, gender, education, job role, and department.
   - Explore correlations between job satisfaction and attrition.
   - Visualize relationships using histograms, bar plots, and box plots.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing data (imputation or removal).
   - Encode categorical variables (JobRole, MaritalStatus, OverTime).
   - Normalize/standardize numerical features (MonthlyIncome, Age, DistanceFromHome).

3. **Correlation & Trend Analysis**
   - Calculate correlations between numerical variables and attrition rates.
   - Analyze trends in performance ratings by job role and department.
   - Create cross-tabulations and heatmaps to visualize relationships.

### Part 2: Visualization

4. **Data Visualization**
   - **Hypothesis testing**: Impact of Education Level on Job Role and Attrition,  
   - **Bar & Box Plots**: Show distributions of key variables and their relationship to attrition.
   - **Heatmaps**: Visualize the correlation matrix to identify patterns.
   - **Interactive Dashboards**: Use Tableau/PowerBI for dynamic exploration of data.

5. **Retention Strategy Development**
   - Suggest strategies to improve job satisfaction and reduce attrition.
   - Focus on enhancing work-life balance and addressing dissatisfaction.
   - Target high-risk groups for tailored retention strategies.
